#This repository was created to show how I learned and where I'll be over time. 
I'll organize the courses I took into folders, and these folders will contain the projects I completed in those courses. 
In each commit, I'll indicate the technologies I used and what I've learned since the previous commit.

### Folder **freeCodeCamp**
The first folder I created is **freeCodeCamp**, a free resource for learning programming, located at *freecodecamp.org*. 
Here, I plan to learn the basics of markup and basic JavaScript.
